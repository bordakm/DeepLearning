VITMAV45 Deep Learning homework

Our team name is **Autonomous brigade**.

The team members are:
  - Pelle Mátyás
  - Németh Gábor
  - Bordák Máté

Our task is to generate dog images using GAN networks. 
For the Deep Learning environment we used Google Colab.
## To get started:

Everything you need to run the project, including training and testing is explained step by step in DogGenerator.ipynb

  - Load the Jupyter Notebook found in this project in Google Colab
  - Don't forget to set Hardware acceleration to GPU
  - To avoid waiting hours for the dataset to download, skip to step 1.2, and run all cells from there
